# DomainEvents

This repository demonstrates how to implement Domain Events in a C# application using the **MediatR** library. It showcases a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach, focusing on decoupled communication between different parts of the system through domain events. The project integrates with the **CQRS** pattern to separate command and query responsibilities, providing a scalable and maintainable architecture. Ideal for developers seeking practical examples of event-driven architecture in enterprise applications.
